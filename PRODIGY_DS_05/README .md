# Road Accident Data Analysis

## 📝  Project Overview
As part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech, I successfully completed my fift task, which involved creating Road Accident Data Analysis. This project involves analyzing road accident data using Microsoft Excel to identify patterns, trends, and potential risk factors associated with road accidents. The analysis aims to provide insights that can inform policy decisions, improve road safety measures, and raise awareness about the importance of safe driving practices.
This task helped me enhance my skills in data visualization and analysis using Excel.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is titled **"Road Accident Data.xlsx"** and contains various features related to road accidents, such as:

- **Date**: The date when the accident occurred.
- **Location**: The location or area where the accident took place.
- **Type of Accident**: The category of accident (e.g., collision, rollover, pedestrian involved).
- **Number of Vehicles Involved**: The total number of vehicles involved in the accident.
- **Number of Casualties**: The number of people injured or deceased due to the accident.
- **Weather Conditions**: Weather conditions at the time of the accident.
- **Road Conditions**: The condition of the road (e.g., wet, dry, icy).
- **Time of Day**: The time when the accident occurred.

## 📈 Objectives

- **Analyze Accident Trends**: Identify patterns in road accidents over time and across different locations.
- **Determine Risk Factors**: Investigate the potential risk factors contributing to road accidents, such as weather conditions, road conditions, and time of day.
- **Visualize Data**: Create visualizations in Excel to effectively communicate the findings and insights from the data.
- **Suggest Recommendations**: Provide recommendations for improving road safety based on the analysis.

## 📊Tools and Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.

## 📊Analysis Process

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, incorrect data entries, and any inconsistencies in the dataset using Excel.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed exploratory analysis to understand the distribution and relationships within the data using Excel's features.
3. **Data Visualization**: Created plots and charts using Excel to visualize trends, patterns, and correlations.
4. **Risk Factor Analysis**: Identified and analyzed potential risk factors associated with road accidents using Excel formulas and functions.
5. **Recommendations**: Provided insights and recommendations based on the analysis conducted in Excel.

## Excel File Structure

The Excel file contains the following sheets:

1. **Raw Data**: The original dataset with all the columns mentioned above.
2. **Cleaned Data**: The processed data after cleaning for analysis.
3. **Trends Analysis**: Analysis of accident trends over time and by location.
4. **Risk Factors**: Analysis of potential risk factors contributing to road accidents.
5. **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs created to visualize the findings.
6. **Summary**: A summary of key findings and recommendations.
