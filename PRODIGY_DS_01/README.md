# Gender Distribution Data Visualization in Excel

## 📝 Description

As part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech, I successfully completed my first task, which involved creating a clustered bar chart to visualize the gender distribution across different states and Union Territories in India. This task helped me enhance my skills in data visualization and analysis using Excel.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Data Source**: Population data of India, including gender distribution across various states and Union Territories.
- **Visualization Type**: Clustered Bar Chart.
- **Purpose**: To compare male and female populations across different regions.
- **Interactive Elements**: Utilized slicers to filter data by specific states or regions, making the analysis more dynamic and insightful.

## 📈 Steps to Create the Bar Chart

### Data Preparation

- Loaded the dataset into Excel and cleaned the data for analysis.
- Using formulas and logic, created a new table "Region" for the population map, which includes different regions in India: "North, South, East, West, and Union Territory."

### Pivot Table

- Inserted a pivot table for data analysis, which includes different tables on gender distribution.
- Selected relevant columns: State/UT, Male, and Female.

### Chart Creation

- Inserted a clustered bar chart using the selected columns.
- Adjusted chart settings for better visualization and readability.

### Creating Dashboard

- Implemented slicers to enable filtering by specific states or regions, providing an interactive experience for users.
- Created interactive dashboards by adding maps, graphs, and charts for visualization.

## 🌟 Learnings

- Improved proficiency in data visualization using Excel.
- Gained experience in handling and analyzing large datasets.
- Developed skills in creating interactive dashboards to convey insights effectively.
